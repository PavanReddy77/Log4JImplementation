	//Logs are used to know what is happening in every line at the time of execution or at Run Time.
	
	//Levels of Logs:
	//1. Info.
	//2. Warn.
	//3. Error.
	//4. Fatal.
	
	//To Generate the Logs, we use Apache Lo4J API. [We have added Log4J Dependency into Pom.xml].
	//It works by reading Log4J Configuration from Log4J.properties file.
	
	//It is always good practice to create Log4J.properties file inside src/main/resouces package.
